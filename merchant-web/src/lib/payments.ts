/**
 * Only meaningful when `payment.settlement` is null (an installment that didn't itself
 * complete its link — 04-BACKEND-HANDOFF.md gotcha #5). Uses the link's CURRENT status and
 * totals (`payment.link.status`/`quotedUSDC`/`receivedUSDC`, added in PR #5) as the source of
 * truth — never infer this by searching other rows on the same page for a "completing"
 * payment, which silently gives the wrong answer whenever that payment isn't in the current
 * page of results, or (as caught in review) when the link is still `underpaid` and nothing
 * has completed it yet.
 *
 * Defensive fallback: `link.status` is typed as required, but if a deploy is ever behind the
 * merged contract (seen once already — PR #5 landed in docs/api.types.ts before the live
 * testnet backend had redeployed it) these fields come back `undefined` at runtime. Render a
 * generic label instead of literally showing "undefined".
